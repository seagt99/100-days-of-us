    <h1>üíå to my love, on our 100th day</h1>
    
    <p>hi, my heart.</p>

    <p>it‚Äôs been 100 days  
    <br>100 sunrises since the day we said, ‚Äúyes, this is us‚Äù  
    <br>100 nights of falling asleep thinking of you  
    <br>100 moments, big and small, that have only deepened what i already knew so early on  
    <br>you are it  
    <br>you are the one</p>

    <p>i still remember the very beginning, how effortless it felt to fall into you  
    <br>how our connection didn‚Äôt feel new ‚Äî it felt remembered, like a song i'd always known the words to  
    <br>with you, there was no guessing  
    <br>no pretending  
    <br>just home  
    <br><br>you saw me, in ways i didn‚Äôt even know i needed to be seen  
    <br>and more than that, you stayed  
    <br>you chose me</p>

    <p>and yet, love, choosing you is the easiest thing i‚Äôve ever done</p>

    <p>but god, this distance  
    <br>it hasn‚Äôt been easy  
    <br>some days it aches so loudly  
    <br>the kind of ache that sits in your chest and makes everything a little heavier  
    <br>i‚Äôve missed you in ways i didn‚Äôt know were possible  
    <br>missed your voice not through a speaker  
    <br>missed your skin, your scent, the way your hand fits in mine like it was made for it</p>

    <p>and then april came  
    <br>that one visit  
    <br>it changed everything  
    <br>seeing you, holding you, kissing you without a screen between us  
    <br>it was the closest thing to magic i‚Äôve ever known
    <br>the closest thing to heaven
    <br>those few days felt like a dream i never wanted to wake up from  
    <br>you were real in my arms, not just in my mind, and it reminded me why this love is so worth it  
    <br>because the moment i touched you, i knew again  
    <br>this is where i belong  
    <br>right here  
    <br>with you</p>

    <p>every goodbye, in person, on the phone, since has been a silent war between gratitude and grief  
    <br>grateful we found this, devastated to be pulled apart again  
    <br>but through it all, my love stays  
    <br>strong  
    <br>grounding  
    <br>constant  
    <br>and now, knowing i get to see you again soon  
    <br>it‚Äôs what keeps me breathing softer  
    <br>it‚Äôs the light at the end of the ache</p>

    <p>these 100 days have tested us in every way, and still, i‚Äôve never once doubted you  
    <br>because you're my twin flame  
    <br>my mirror and my muse  
    <br>my softness and my strength  
    <br>you are the most beautiful thing i‚Äôve ever known  
    <br>and i don‚Äôt just love you  
    <br>i know i‚Äôm meant for you  
    <br>completely  
    <br>wholly  
    <br>endlessly</p>

    <p>if these 100 days have taught me anything, it‚Äôs that no amount of distance can dull what we have  
    <br>we were written in the stars long before we ever met  
    <br>and i will spend my life loving you, choosing you, and reminding you just how deeply you are cherished</p>

    <p>here‚Äôs to 100 days  
    <br>here‚Äôs to forever</p>
