    <h1>üíå to my love, on our 100th day</h1>
    
    <p>hi, my heart.</p>

    <p>it‚Äôs been 100 days  
    100 sunrises since the day we said, ‚Äúyes, this is us‚Äù  
    100 nights of falling asleep thinking of you  
    100 moments, big and small, that have only deepened what i already knew so early on  
    you are it  
    you are the one</p>

    <p>i still remember the very beginning, how effortless it felt to fall into you  
    how our connection didn‚Äôt feel new ‚Äî it felt remembered, like a song i'd always known the words to  
    with you, there was no guessing  
    no pretending  
    just home  
    you saw me, in ways i didn‚Äôt even know i needed to be seen  
    and more than that, you stayed  
    you chose me</p>

    <p>and yet, love, choosing you is the easiest thing i‚Äôve ever done</p>

    <p>but god, this distance  
    it hasn‚Äôt been easy  
    some days it aches so loudly  
    the kind of ache that sits in your chest and makes everything a little heavier  
    i‚Äôve missed you in ways i didn‚Äôt know were possible  
    missed your voice not through a speaker  
    missed your skin, your scent, the way your hand fits in mine like it was made for it</p>

    <p>and then april came  
    that one visit  
    it changed everything  
    seeing you, holding you, kissing you without a screen between us  
    it was the closest thing to magic i‚Äôve ever known  
    those few days felt like a dream i never wanted to wake up from  
    you were real in my arms, not just in my mind, and it reminded me why this love is so worth it  
    because the moment i touched you, i knew again  
    this is where i belong  
    right here  
    with you</p>

    <p>every goodbye since has been a silent war between gratitude and grief  
    grateful we found this, devastated to be pulled apart again  
    but through it all, the love stays  
    strong  
    grounding  
    constant  
    and now, knowing i get to see you again soon  
    it‚Äôs what keeps me breathing softer  
    it‚Äôs the light at the end of the ache</p>

    <p>these 100 days have tested us in every way, and still, i‚Äôve never once doubted you  
    because you are my twin flame  
    my mirror and my muse  
    my softness and my strength  
    you are the most beautiful thing i‚Äôve ever known  
    and i don‚Äôt just love you  
    i know i‚Äôm meant for you  
    completely  
    wholly  
    endlessly</p>

    <p>if these 100 days have taught me anything, it‚Äôs that no amount of distance can dull what we have  
    we were written in the stars long before we ever met  
    and i will spend my life loving you, choosing you, and reminding you just how deeply you are cherished</p>

    <p>here‚Äôs to 100 days  
    here‚Äôs to forever</p>
