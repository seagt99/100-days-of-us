    <h2>each song, a page in our story ðŸ’Œ</h2>

    <div class="song">
      <strong>1. cigarettes & feelings - the haunt</strong><br />
      this one is the first song you've shared with me, the first one that made me feel like it was already not just you and me, but us.
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <strong>2. right now - akon</strong><br />
      a silly memory of us singing on mute during our study sessions. i cherish every little moment of us so deeply that it became a song that always reminds me of you.
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <strong>3. beauty and a beat - justin bieber, Nicki minaj</strong><br />
      close your eyes. do you see us, in the taxi's backseat, singing together like nothing else matters while we're on our way back to a room where it's just us and our love?
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <strong>4. ditto - newjeans</strong><br />
      i told you, it's always been my favorite song, but now this song encapsulates how nostalgic i am of the warmth of your smile.
    </div>

    <div class="song">
      <strong>5. sailor song - gigi perez</strong><br />
      this one plays in the background every time i realize how much better life got with you in it.
    </div>

   <div class="song">
      <strong>6. please be rude - gigi perez</strong><br />
      if there's a song i could've written for you, it would be this one. this is how in love i am with you - devotedly.
    </div>

   <div class="song">
      <strong>7. i wanna be yours - arctic monkeys</strong><br />
       if i could melt into your life, i would. this song says everything my heart mumbles when words fall short. i donâ€™t just love you, i *wanna be yours.*
    </div>

   <div class="song">
      <strong>8. japanese denim - daniel caesar</strong><br />
       this is the first song i made you discover, and god i was so happy you liked it. back then, when i couldn't let my heart speak fully yet, this was all i needed: for you to know, even just for a song.
    </div>

   <div class="song">
      <strong>9. facetime - shy smith</strong><br />
       my first memory of how burning my desire still is for you.
    </div>

   <div class="song">
      <strong>10. soft spot - keshi</strong><br />
        this is ours. every time it plays, itâ€™s like the world fades and itâ€™s just us again. your voice, my heart, and that feeling we donâ€™t have to explain. this song found the quiet corner where our love lives, and now itâ€™s home forever.
    </div>

   <div class="song">
      <strong>11. sweater weather - the neighbourhood</strong><br />
        because ur my warmth in every season. the kind that doesnâ€™t just wrap around me, but settles in my chest and stays. i donâ€™t need a sweater when i have you, youâ€™re where safe feels like something i can hold onto.
    </div>

   <div class="song">
      <strong>12. raabta - pritam, arijit singh</strong><br />
        kehte hai khuda ne is jahaan mein sabhi ke liye, kisi na kisi ko hai banaya har kisi ke liye, tera milna hai us rab ka ishaara maanu, mujhko banaya tere jaise hi kisi ke liye.
